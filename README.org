* remotestorage-bookmarks-chrome

A chrome extension to synchronize all your bookmarks with remotestorage - at some point in the future.

Currently it can just push your bookmarks into remotestorage, not pull them in from there, but that's to come.

To verify that the bookmarks actually ended up in remotestorage, use [[http://seven20.epic720.5apps.com/][seven20]] to browse your data.
